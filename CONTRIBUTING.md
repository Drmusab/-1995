## Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/)
- Use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for code formatting
- Use [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) for import sorting
- Maximum line length: 100 characters

### Type Hints

- Use type hints for all function signatures
- Use `typing` module for complex types
- Use `Optional` for nullable parameters

### Documentation

- Write docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Use Google-style docstrings
- Include examples in docstrings when helpful

### Testing

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Use descriptive test names
- Include integration tests for complex features

## Contribution Types

### Bug Reports

When reporting bugs, please include:

- Clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Environment details (Python version, OS, etc.)
- Relevant error messages or logs

### Feature Requests

For new features, please provide:

- Clear description of the feature
- Use cases and motivation
- Proposed implementation approach
- Potential impact on existing functionality

### Pull Requests

#### Before Submitting

- [ ] Tests pass locally
- [ ] Code is formatted and linted
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Changes are backwards compatible (or breaking changes are noted)
- [ ] Commit messages follow conventions

#### PR Guidelines

1. **Title**: Use clear, descriptive titles
2. **Description**: Explain what changes were made and why
3. **Testing**: Describe how you tested your changes
4. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation
5. **Breaking Changes**: Clearly mark any breaking changes

### Commit Message Conventions

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Formatting changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat(api): add GraphQL endpoint for user queries
fix(memory): resolve memory leak in cache cleanup
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

## Architecture Guidelines

### Component Design

- Follow single responsibility principle
- Use dependency injection for loose coupling
- Implement proper error handling
- Add comprehensive logging

### API Design

- Follow RESTful principles for REST APIs
- Use semantic versioning for API changes
- Provide clear error messages
- Include proper authentication/authorization

### Performance

- Profile code for performance bottlenecks
- Implement efficient algorithms
- Use caching appropriately
- Monitor memory usage

### Security

- Validate all inputs
- Use secure defaults
- Implement proper authentication
- Follow security best practices

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure

```python
def test_feature_description():
    # Arrange
    setup_test_data()
    
    # Act
    result = function_under_test()
    
    # Assert
    assert result == expected_value
```

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions/classes
2. **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
3. **E2E Tests**: Test complete workflows
4. **Performance Tests**: Test performance characteristics

### Mocking

- Mock external dependencies
- Use fixtures for test data
- Keep mocks simple and focused

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Document all public APIs
- Include usage examples
- Explain complex algorithms
- Document configuration options

### User Documentation

- Write clear user guides
- Include step-by-step tutorials
- Provide troubleshooting guides
- Keep documentation up-to-date

## Review Process

### Review Criteria

1. **Functionality**: Does the code work as intended?
2. **Quality**: Is the code well-written and maintainable?
3. **Testing**: Are there adequate tests?
4. **Documentation**: Is documentation updated?
5. **Performance**: Are there performance implications?

### Review Timeline

- Initial review: 2-3 business days
- Follow-up reviews: 1-2 business days
- Urgent fixes: Same day

## Release Process

1. Version bumping follows semantic versioning
2. Changelog is updated for each release
3. Documentation is updated
4. Tests pass on all supported platforms
5. Security review for significant changes
