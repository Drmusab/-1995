# AI Assistant to n8n Integration Project

This project creates a comprehensive n8n integration for the AI Assistant system, enabling users to incorporate advanced AI capabilities into their n8n workflows.

## Project Overview

The AI Assistant is a sophisticated AI system with multimodal processing, workflow orchestration, and an extensible plugin system. This project adapts its capabilities into n8n nodes, making AI assistant features accessible within n8n workflows.

## Key Components

- **AI Assistant Skill Node**: Execute AI skills and manage notes
- **AI Assistant Workflow Node**: Process complex tasks and system management

### 2. Core Features Exposed

#### Chat and Conversation
- Send messages to the AI Assistant
- Maintain conversation context through sessions
- Get chat history and manage sessions

#### Memory Management
- Store important facts and information
- Retrieve relevant memories based on queries
- Search through stored knowledge with similarity scoring
- Update and manage memory entries

#### Skill Execution
- Execute specific AI skills and capabilities
- Note-taking functionality (create, update, search, export notes)
- List available skills and get skill information

#### Workflow Orchestration
- Process messages with advanced options (memory, learning, temperature)
- Execute complex multi-step tasks
- Monitor system health and status

## Technical Implementation

### Node Architecture
Each n8n node is implemented as a TypeScript class following n8n's node development patterns:

- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with proper type definitions
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with continue-on-fail support
- **Authentication**: Multiple authentication methods (API key, basic auth)
- **Validation**: Input validation and sanitization
- **Documentation**: Inline help and parameter descriptions

### API Integration
The nodes communicate with the AI Assistant through its REST API:

- **Base URL Configuration**: Configurable server endpoint
- **Authentication**: Secure credential management
- **Request/Response Handling**: Proper JSON serialization and error handling
- **Timeout Management**: Configurable timeouts for different operation types

### Development Tools
Complete development and build pipeline:

- **TypeScript Compilation**: Modern TypeScript with strict type checking
- **ESLint**: n8n-specific linting rules for node development
- **Prettier**: Consistent code formatting
- **Build Pipeline**: Automated build process with asset management
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing framework support
